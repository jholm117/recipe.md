# How to Make Flax “Eggs”

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds,* also known as flaxseed meal
- 3 tablespoons water

## Directions

1. Combine the ground flax and water in a small bowl (if your recipe calls for multiple eggs, just multiply the ingredients as necessary and mix in the same bowl). Stir with a fork until combined.
2. Let the mixture rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes, until it’s somewhat “gloppy” or congealed. Use in place of the eggs in your baking project!
